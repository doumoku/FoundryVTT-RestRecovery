# Rest Recovery Changelog

## Version 1.11.4
- Fixed bug when trying to prompt rest with non-actor tokens on the scene

## Version 1.11.3
- Fixed NPC rests when using Tidy (only from their sheet - still don't support adding them in a prompted rest)
  - Due to improvements made to NPC actor data in dnd5e v3.2.0, NPCs should now mostly be able to benefit from the full Rest Recovery workflow; in dnd5e v3.1.x, however, NPC rests will simply use the core rest methods

## Version 1.11.2
- Actors with tokens on the viewed scene will now appear at the top of the rest prompt list dropdown
- Selected actors for a rest prompt are now remembered across browsers
  - The data will be stored on the user who prompts the rest, upon modifying the selected actors or initiating a rest from the prompt
- Removed some deprecation warnings

## Version 1.11.1
- Updated chat message flavor to reflect custom rest times

## Version 1.11.0
- Added a the ability to configure hit die rolls to be done with advantage, or automatically maxed (thanks f4hy on github!)
- Moved the fractional hp recovery from HD rolls to the general tab, as it effects all hit die rolls, not only those taken during short rests

## Version 1.10.4
- Fixed a forge-only bug when enabling One D&D Exhaustion

## Version 1.10.3
- Fixed a bunch of small bugs relating to various resource/spell recoveries that were introduced in version 1.8.0

## Version 1.10.2
- Updated fractional hp recovery from HD rolls to use the same dropdown as Periapt of Wound Closure's dropdown for how to multiply hit die rolls

## Version 1.10.1
- Removed libwrapper dependency
- Translation updates (thanks Kharmans!)

## Version 1.10.0
- Added an option for fractional hp recovery from hit die rolls (e.g. all HD rolls are halved, quartered, or auto-zero; bonuses - like CON mod - are not multiplied)

## Version 1.9.1
- Fixed a bug where food/water-related special traits wouldn't show up unless world was reloaded

## Version 1.9.0
- Now _fully_ implements RAW exhaustion - in addition to the existing speed & hp max decreases, the appropriate rolls will receive disadvantage at certain exhaustion levels
  - Ability Checks (including skill checks) will receive disadvantage if at exhaustion 1 or above
  - Attack Rolls and Saving Throws (including concentration saves & death saves) will receive disadvantage if at exhaustion 3 or above
  - The above only applies if One D&D Exhaustion is not enabled
  - If "fast-forwarding" rolls, this will happen automatically, rolling with disadvantage, or as a straight roll if it was determined by some other module (or by holding down a keybind) that the roll should have advantage for some reason
  - Otherwise, in roll dialog, the appropriate option (again, either disadvantage or normal) will be highlighted
- Added automatic support for [Automated Conditions 5e](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/automated-conditions-5e) - if installed & AC5e exhaustion automation is enabled, Rest Recovery will let AC5e handle the effects (unless Rest Recovery is set to use One D&D Exhaustion).

## Version 1.8.0
- Should now be V12 and dnd5e 3.2 compatible while maintaining V11 & 3.1.x functionality

## Version 1.7.0
- Updated TyphonJS and Svelte to more current releases, should see no change in user experience, but maybe some improved performance
- Fixed an error being logged to console every time the settings menu was opened

## Version 1.6.9.4
- Fixed (one) error logged to console on world startup

## Version 1.6.9.3
- Fixed bug where world would restart & UI would become unusable after trying to save settings (HUGE thanks to Christopher on discord)

## Version 1.6.9.2
- Fixed bug where One D&D Exhaustion effect would not be removed if exhaustion on an actor changed after reverting from One D&D to normal exhaustion

## Version 1.6.9.1
- Fixed missing compendium & asset data

## Version 1.6.9
- Added automatic recognition of "Rations (1 day)" imported using DDBI.

## Version 1.6.8
- Added reference journal entry for One D&D Exhaustion condition (in Brazilian Portuguese as well - thanks Kharmans!)

## Version 1.6.7
- Various exhaustion fixes
  - New icons for One D&D Exhaustion levels (thanks mythacri!)
  - The "exhaustion integrations" option is currently disabled, as the only option (DFreds CE) doesn't play nice with any exhaustion automations
    - You can still use CE (and even set effects to "replace" now, if you want), just know that the CE exhaustion effects will not be applied
  - If you use the [Alternative Exhaustion 5e](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/alternative-exhaustion-5e) module, you won't have to/be able to enable One D&D Exhaustion in the Rest Recovery settings (it will already be handled by Alternative Exhaustion)
    - If you currently use Alternative Exhaustion with "Manual Adjustment" enabled, and decide to remove it in favor of only using Rest Recovery, ensure you remove any "Global Bonuses" you have set which rely on exhaustion, as the -1 per exhaustion level is automatically handled by Rest Recovery
  - Fixed an issue where using One D&D Exhaustion resulted in the "normal" exhaustion debuffs happening on top of the expected debuffs

## Version 1.6.6.1
- Made One D&D sheet modification an option, so as not to conflict with other potentially compatible exhaustion modules

## Version 1.6.6
- Added compatibility with "new" 5e actor sheet
  - Now shows resource recovery configuration option above "Favorites" section
  - If One D&D exhaustion exabled, will now have 10 exhaustion pips to click
    - Currently exhaustion 6-10 will show the wrong icon, as there are no core icons for those exhaustion levels (besides 6, which shows a little red skull exhaustion icon)
- Translation updates (thanks Kharmans!)

## Version 1.6.5

- Fixed compatibility with Tidy5e sheets
  - Custom resource recovery should now be visible in the traits list in the Attributes tab
  - Enabling/disabling One D&D exhaustion will now enable/disable it for Tidy5e as well (you'll have to save settings at least once if you're already using both Tidy5e and have One D&D exhaustion enabled)
  - Warning will now properly be displayed if a food/water consumable has an invalid number of max charges with food/water automation turned on
  - Custom Recovery checkbox now properly enables the custom recovery formula field
  - Fixed widths of item sheet checkboxes to not cut off text

## Version 1.6.4

- Fixed a bug where consuming the final charge of a food/water item that was set to destroy on empty would not properly update the character's hunger/thirst level
- Added optional cost of fully/half sating hunger and thirst through external sources (e.g. meals/drinks at a tavern)
  - This is currently globally configured, with checkboxes for enabling food & water costs individually, and cost settings for full & half for both
    - Per-scene configuration is unlikely to be implemented, so if you anticipate different costs in the same session I'd recommend creating different rest profiles ahead of time
  - The cost for full or half will be the same regardless of whether the resting characters have already eaten (after all, you don't get a refund for the amount of a meal that you didn't eat)
  - If a character doesn't have enough money to "externally source" the options they've selected, they won't be able to continue the rest until changing their selection to one they can afford
  - The currency will be automatically deducted from the character's inventory, performing currency conversions only when necessary

## Version 1.6.3

- Added new "Custom" rest variant, accessible via the Quick Setup menu in the variant dropdown
  - Selecting this variant will allow you to enter your own custom Long & Short Rest lengths in the Quick Setup menu
  - Lengths are variable down to the nearest 0.05 hours (3 minutes)

## Version 1.6.2

- Removed branding from General Settings
- Added setting that when enabled logs all rests as Simple Calendar notes (requires player permissions for "Create Journal Entries" and Simple Calendar "Add Notes")

    - `flags.dae.rest-recovery.prevent.longRest`
